# Simulation-Rate-Counting
##Rate counting scripts for calibration simulations

These scripts take in an output g4cuore file generated by simulations and calculate the expected time to calibrate each channel

plot_AllString_Th232Peaks.cc is the main script to be run on this output file, and considers a time associated with the expected "length" of the calibration, generally done as a 10-day calibration.

Hard-coded into the script is the number of events in the peak to calibrate, which determines how many events a peak needs to be considered "calibrated".

This generates an output ROOT file named AllPeaks_rate.root which contains information on the rates of each of the peaks, and, in addition, contains an ordered list for having N number of peaks calibrated.

This file is then used in plot_NChannelsCalibrated.C (the lightning plots) to show how many uncalibrated channels there are for each peak as a function of time. This is used to determine how long a calibration needs to be, for example.
